This project, completed with guidance from QuantInsti, **explores key financial analytics techniques and quantitative modelling** through the following steps:

- **Log Returns and Risk Analysis**: Calculated the standard deviation and covariance of log returns for two assets.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Derived the optimal portfolio weights for a given risk constraint.
- **Bollinger Bands**: Developed and visualized Bollinger Bands to study price trends and volatility.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Estimated the 90% Confidence Conditional Value-at-Risk (C-VaR) using Monte Carlo methods.
