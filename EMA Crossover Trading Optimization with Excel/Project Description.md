**"EMA Crossover Strategy Optimization"**
This project involves implementing a dynamic **EMA Crossover Trading Strategy**. The strategy uses short-term and long-term Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) to generate buy/sell signals. Key highlights include:
1. Optimization of SEMA and LEMA parameters for maximum profitability using a data table.
2. Computation of critical performance metrics like CAGR, hit ratio, and maximum drawdown.
3. Development of equity curves for different leverage levels.
4. Calendar year-wise breakdown of profits, losses, and hit ratios.

The strategy's dynamic nature ensures adaptability to parameter changes and provides actionable insights for trading performance evaluation.
